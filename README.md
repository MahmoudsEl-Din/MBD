# MBD
MATLAB and Model Based Design 

# Repository Overview

This repository is organized into: MATLAB and Model-Based Design (MBD). Each directory contains the tasks submission of topics related to MATLAB programming and Model-Based Design in Simulink, respectively.

## MATLAB Directory

The MATLAB directory is structured into three topics, The structure is as follows:

- `Topic_1`: Contains Traffic_Light task.
- `Topic_2`: Includes more advanced MATLAB scripts, divided into:
  - `Calculator`: Scripts for basic arithmetic operations.
  - `HappyOrSad`: A simple emotion detection algorithm.
- `Topic_3`: Contains Traffic Light Modes task.

## Model-Based Design (MBD) Directory

The MBD directory focuses on the application of Model-Based Design using Simulink. It is organized into topics that cover various aspects of MBD, including scalar calculations, bitwise operations, loops, conditional statements, and counters.

### Topic 1: Basic Operations

- `Average`: Calculates the sum, maximum, minimum, and average of an array.
- `Bitwise`: Performs bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR) between two operands and NOT operation for each.
- `Calculator`: A scalar calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, unary minus, increment, and decrement operations.

### Topic 2: Control Structures and Functions

- `EvenOdd`: Determines if a number is even or odd.
- `Factorial_ForLoop`: Calculates factorial using a for loop with MATLAB Function block for code generation.
- `Factorial_WhileLoop`: Implements factorial calculation using a while loop.
- `GradingSystem`: Evaluates grades using conditional statements.
- `Calculator`: Demonstrates the use of subsystems in calculations, including configuration changes and code generation analysis.

### Topic 3: Counters

- `Incremental_Counter`: Implements an incremental counter using the Unit Delay block.
- `Decremental_Counter`: Implements a decremental counter using the Unit Delay block.

### Topic 4: 

### Topic 5: 

- `Calculator`
- `Counter`
- `Factorial`
- `Traffic_Light`
